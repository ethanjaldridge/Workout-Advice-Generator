# Workout-Advice-Generator

This is my project for the codecademy "mixed-messages" assignment. The project creates a randomized workout advice message consisting of 3 pieces of data everytime you run the program. Each piece of data (goal, start, and stop) only has a few variables to output, so the program is very basic.
